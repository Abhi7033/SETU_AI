# Presentation: Setu (Sanjeevani) AI

## Slide 1: Title Slide
- **Title:** Setu (Sanjeevani) AI
- **Subtitle:** The Rural Health Bridge
- **Tagline:** Empowering Frontline Workers with Voice & AI
- **Team Name:** [Your Team Name]

## Slide 2: The Problem (The "Why")
- **Healthcare Desert:** 70% of India lives in rural areas, but 80% of doctors are in cities.
- **The Information Gap:** Language barriers prevent accurate diagnosis. An ASHA worker speaks dialect; the remote doctor speaks English/Hindi.
- **Delay Kills:** Critical conditions are missed because paper forms take too long to fill and process.

## Slide 3: The Solution (The "What")
- **Setu AI:** An intelligent, offline-first mobile assistant for ASHA workers.
- **Voice-to-Clinical-Note:** Converts local dialect speech -> Structured English Medical Records.
- **Smart Triage:** Instantly flags emergencies (Red/Yellow/Green) on-device without internet.
- **Rx Translator:** Scans prescriptions and explains them in the patient's language.

## Slide 4: How It Works (The "How")
- **Step 1:** ASHA worker speaks: "Patient has high fever and stiff neck."
- **Step 2:** AI (Whisper + Llama-2) processes speech -> Text -> Structured Data.
- **Step 3:** App displays: "Possible Meningitis. RED FLAG. Refer immediately."
- **Step 4:** Record is synced to the Cloud for the District Medical Officer.

## Slide 5: Impact & Feasibility
- **Feasible:** Uses existing open-source models (Llama, Whisper) trained on public data.
- **Scalable:** Pure software solution (Mobile App). Can be deployed to 1 Million+ ASHA workers.
- **Impact:** Reduces diagnosis time by 50%. Increases medication adherence by 40%.

## Slide 6: The Vision
- "To ensure that language and distance never stand in the way of life-saving healthcare."
- **Future:** Integration with Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission (ABDM).
